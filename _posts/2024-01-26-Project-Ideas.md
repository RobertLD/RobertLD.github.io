I often find myself short on project ideas to explore in my free time. I'm making an effort here to keep track of project ideas I've had or found and are interested in pursuing.

## Project Ideas

1. CLI application called `td` that takes the input and makes a todo item in the daily obsidian note with the timestamp of when it was made
2. Using elixir/F# to build a simple website with as little dependency on JavaScript as possible
3. LLM trained specifically on the AST representation of a specific programming language.
4. Anything from the [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) list
	1. Build your own Database
	2. Create a programming language
	3. Customized text editor with LSP support
5. Build a mobile app that reminds users if they've taken their pills today or not
6. Website that is a decision matrix for which programming language to learn next based on user provided information. Tech: Golang/ HTMX
7. PQL and SQL wrapper around parquet files with a GUI interface similar to datagrip.
8. NoSQL database designed specifically around one type of data. Could be vectors, could be strings, could be... something else?
9. OpenAPI client generator. Parse a swagger document and generate a client for interacting with that specific API.
10. Personal Finance simulator and decision maker
11. Parquet/CSV file combiner and splitter cli tool
12. Remote SQL driver server. Spin up the simple web-server and let it handle the querying and sending the results back. For databases without HTTP support
13. Evolution simulation game with simple plants and animals (Golang?)
14. Anomaly Detection ML model build on top of Loki logs
15. Market Trading Simulator using Agents with simple Neural Networks existing as Coroutines. They interact real-time with a global market data-structure
