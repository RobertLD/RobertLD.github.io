### Statistics
Personally I think statistics is one of the more interesting areas of mathematics, in that it is immediately useful, pervasive in everyday life and underpins a large portion of the business world. It's a shame then that the entirety of my knowledge in statistics has vanished post university. I'm using this collection of thoughts as a place to document myself, brushing up on my statistics knowledge
